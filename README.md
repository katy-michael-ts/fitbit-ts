# Fitbit Time Series Project
## By Kathryn Salts & Michael Moran

This project is a time series analysis of mysterious data from a Fitbit.
We created a model to forecast the missing weeks of data from the Fitbit.
We concluded that the wearer of the Fitbit was an employee of our company.

This project is composed of
1. a Jupyter notebook containing our analysis;
1. a CSV file containing our predictions for the missing weeks; and
1. a presentation of our model and conclusions, [available here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10AzAyjr-Wq86x9uDnHjAXWTNsNbtmpLLLA304DKALAQ/edit?usp=sharing).
